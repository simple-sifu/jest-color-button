# Testing Philosophy
> Test your software the way users actually use it.
  - not internal implementation
  - Find elments by accessiblity markers, not test Ids

# Jest
> Test runner that
  - finds tests
  - runs tests
  - determines whether tests pass or fail


# React Testing Library
> Creates Virtual DOM for testing
> has utilities for interacting with DOM
> allows testing w/o a browser

# Unit Tests
> tests one unit of code in isolation

# Integration tests
> How multiple unit work together

# Examples of Screen Readers
- getByRole
- getByLabelText
- getByText
- getByDisplayValue
- getByTitle
- getByTestId
